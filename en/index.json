Commands: /hoje → Returns today’s menu. /semana → Returns the full week’s menu. Web Scraping # Uses Cheerio to extract menus directly from UFPA’s RU website. Formats meals with emojis for clarity (main dish, vegetarian option, side dishes). REST API # Provides programmatic access to menus in JSON format: /hoje → Today’s menu. /semana → Weekly menu. Security \u0026amp; Reliability # Implements rate limiting with telegraf-ratelimit. Includes error handling for scraping failures. Tech Stack # Language: TypeScript Framework: NestJS Scraping: Cheerio Telegram integration: Telegraf, nestjs-telegraf Tooling: ESLint + Prettier, Jest (unit \u0026amp; e2e tests), dotenv Project Structure # The bot follows a modular architecture within a NestJS application:\nsrc/scraper/ → Extracts menus from the RU website. src/formatter/ → Formats scraped data for Telegram. src/bot/ → Handles commands and Telegram integration. src/app.controller.ts → REST API endpoints for menus. User: /semana\nBot: Lists the menu for each weekday with emojis.\nInstallation \u0026amp; Running # Prerequisites # Node.js 18+ and npm. Telegram bot token (via BotFather).
